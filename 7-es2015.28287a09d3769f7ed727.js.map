If several words appear in the string, only the last word is pluralized -- this\n * means that if \"your story\" was passed in, \"your stories\" would be passed out.\n *\n * @param {string} singularEntity - Entity to pluralize. Pass as a singular ('story' or 'house').\n *          NOTE: The last word is examined. So you can pass in e.g. 'my story'.\n * @param {number} [quantity=0] quantity - How many of the entity are there? If left blank, this will\n *          pluralize the string (e.g. 'story' -> 'stories', 'house' -> 'houses').
